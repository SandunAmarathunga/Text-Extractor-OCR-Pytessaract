You can call it SNOW.\\nYou can call it SLEET. You can call it HAIL.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WATER all the same.\\nDid you ever wonder how old water is or\\nwhere it comes from? The answers may surprise you.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 4 - b' \\n\\nThe next time you see a pond\\nor even a glass of water,\\nthink about how old that water might be.\\nDo you really want to know ?\\n| thought you did.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 5 - b' \\n\\nDid you brush your teeth this morning?\\nWell, some of the water that you used could\\nhave fallen from the sky yesterday, or a week, or\\nmonth ago. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty new.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 6 - b' \\n\\nBut, some part of that water is very old and was\\naround during the time of the dinosaurs, or even\\nlonger. Or maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little newer; like from the\\ntime when the Pharaohs were building pyramids.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 7 - b' \\n\\nYou see there is only a limited amount of\\nwater and it gets recycled.\\nYep! It keeps going round and round.\\nWe call it the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWater Cycle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 8 - b' \\n\\nYes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 You have a question?\\nNo \\xe2\\x80\\x94 It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like a jet-ski or a bicycle for water.\\nIt is nothing you can ride.\\nIt is how water keeps going round and round.\\nLet me explain\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 9 - b' \\n\\nFirst, | would like to say that water is\\nvery important. Imagine an empty lake.\\nThe fish would be very unhappy.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 10 - b' \\n\\nImagine an empty ocean.\\nYour day at the beach would be like\\ngoing to a desert.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 11 - b' \\n\\nAnd since you are\\nmostly made up of water - let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say you\\nwould be a lot lighter.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 12 - b' \\n\\nThe Water Cycle has 4 parts.\\nEvaporation, Condensation\\nPrecipitation, Collection\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 13 - b' \\n\\nEvaporation\\nWhen the water in an ocean, a lake, a pond, a river,\\nor a stream is heated by the sun, it turns into vapor\\nor steam. It then floats into the air.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 14 - b' \\n\\nOf course, when you are out on a hot day,\\nor you exercise, you sweat. Well, guess what!\\nThat evaporates too.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 15 - b' \\n\\nWhat about those drops of dew\\non leaves, or the grass?\\nYes - They too evaporate and become\\na part of the Water Cycle.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 16 - b' \\n\\nCondensation\\nAs the water vapor gets cooled,\\nit changes back into a liquid and turns into clouds.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 17 - b' \\n\\nPrecipitation\\nWhen the air in the clouds cannot hold any more\\nliquid, it falls back to the ground.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 18 - b' \\n\\nIt returns in different ways, depending\\non the temperature and where\\nit comes down. It can fall as rain.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 19 - b' \\n\\nOr, it can fall as snow.\\n(Did you know that no two snowflakes\\nave the same?)\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 20 - b' \\n\\nIt can return as sleet,\\nwhich is like rain that has almost frozen.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 21 - b' \\n\\nOr it can come as hail. Those frozen balls of rain\\nthat can actually break windows and dent cars.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 22 - b' \\n\\nCollection\\nNo matter how it comes down, it is collected and\\nstored. It can fall into the ocean, lake, pond, river,\\nor stream.\\nIf it lands on the ground, it may roll into a river or\\nbe sucked up by the soil.\\nIt may even pass through the ground to an\\nunderground lake or river to be used later.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 23 - b' \\n\\nNow, what happens tomorrow\\nwhen the sun comes out?\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. The Water Cycle starts over again.\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 24 - b' \\n\\nOops,!...the sun is out!\\nBut don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry, Professor Mois Ture will return.\\nAfter all, | am a part of the Water Cycle.\\nEvaporation - Condensation- Precipitation - Collection\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 25 - b'Advertisement\\n\\nYour Story\\nBook!\\n\\nA book specially\\nmade, with you as the\\nmain hero or heroine!\\n\\nDiscover More >\\n\\n \\n\\nPersonalised children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gifts by &\\n=\\nwww.monkeypen.com ww\" 7} cy\\n\\nFree & personalised children\\'s books\\n\\x0c'\nPage # 26 - b\"Ti it 9 le\\n\\noS\\na ad\\n\\nRain, Suew, Sleet, and Hail\\n\\n  \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n\\nScience has never been so much\\nfun.
