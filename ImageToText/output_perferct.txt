ABSTRACT

In the study of content authentication and tamper detection of
digital text documents, there are very limited techniques
available for content authentication of text documents using
digital watermarking techniques. A novel intelligent text zero
watermarking approach based on probabilistic patterns has
been proposed in this paper for content authentication and
tamper detection of English text documents. In the proposed
approach, Markov model of order THREE and letter-based
‘was constructed and abbreviated as LNMZW3 for text
analysis and utilizes the interrelationship between contents of
xziven text to generate the watermark. However, we can extract
this watermark later using extraction and detection algorithms
to identify the status of text document such as authentic, or
tampered, The proposed approach was implemented using
PHP Programming language with Net Beans IDE 7.0.
Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of our
LNMZW3 approach has proved and compared with other
recent approaches with experiments using five datascts of
varying lengths and different volumes of attacks. Results
show that the proposed approach is always detects tampering,
attacks occurred randomly on text even when the tampering
volume is low, mid or high. Comparative results with the
recent approaches shows that the our LNMZW3 approach
provides added value under random insertion and deletion
attacks in terms of performance, watermark robustness and
watermark security. However, it is provide worst
‘enhancement under reorder attacks.

1. INTRODUCTION

With the increasing use of intemet, e-commerce, and other
efficient communication technologies, the copyright
protection and authentication of digital contents, have gained
‘great importance. Most of these digital contents are in text
form such as email, websites, chats, e-commerce, eBooks,
news, and short messaging systems/services (SMS) [1].

 

‘These text documents may be tempered by malicious
attackers, and the modified data can lead to fatal wrong
decision and transaction disputes [2].

Content authentication and tamper detection of digital image,
audio, and video has been of great interest to the researchers.

Recently, copyright protection, content authentication, and
tamper detection of text document attracted the interest of
researchers. Moreover, during the last decade, the research on
text watermarking schemes is mainly focused on issues of
copyright protection, but gave less attention on content
authentication, integrity verification, and tamper detection [4]

 

Various techniques have been proposed for copyright
protection, authentication, and tamper detection for digital
text documents. Digital Watermarking (DWM) techniques are
considered as the most powerful solutions to most of these
problems.

‘The digital watermarking techniques have emerged as a
solution to breaches of copyright protection, tampering
detection, and content authentication of digital media
Researchers have proposed various watermarking approaches,
for images, audio, and video. However, watermarking
approaches for text is very inadequate. The reason behind is
the difficulty to watermark text.

Traditional text watermarking techniques for tampering
detection and text authentication such as format-based
content-based, and image-based have a number of limitations,
In other words, they are not applicable under random
tampering attacks on all types of texts, and they need 10 use
some transformations or modifications on contents of the text
document to embed watermark information within the original
text document itself which results in text capacity, quality,
‘meaning, and value degradation,

 

‘Text watermarking algorithms such as Word Length Zero-
Watermarking, Non-Vowel ASCII Characters Zero-
Watermarking, and content based Zero-Watermarking are not
applicable under random tampering attack to all types of text
documents. These algorithms are restricted to only
alphabetical watermarks, which means they are not applicable
to specialized texts such as legal documents, web contents,
and documents containing financial, accounting, and
mathematical notations. All makes these algorithms
impractical, Furthermore, text watermarking algorithms using
binary text image are not robust against retyping attacks. The
text watermarking methods based on semantics are language
dependent and do not provide a complete practical solution
for all types of texts.

‘The English text zero watermarking algorithm based on the
probabilistic weight of Markov model presented in [24] has a
umber of limitations in that it is not applicable under all
tampering attacks to all type of documents. However, we can
